- Flask was never actually running in production anyway

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Set Up Supabase Database
```bash
1. Copy content from supabase-schema.sql
2. Go to Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
3. Paste and execute the SQL
4. Verify all tables were created
```

### 2. Create First Moderator
```bash
1. Sign up through the website
2. In Supabase: Table Editor → users
3. Change role from 'user' to 'moderator'
```

### 3. Test the System
```bash
1. Visit /test-reviews.html
2. Sign in with email
3. Submit a review
4. Check if it appears
5. Visit /moderation.html
6. Sign in as moderator
7. Approve/reject reviews
```

### 4. Deploy
```bash
The system now works with:
- ✅ Netlify (static hosting)
- ✅ Vercel (static hosting)
- ✅ Any static file host
- ✅ No backend server needed!
```
