## Overview

Successfully moved the reviews section above the rating stars on all 136 business detail pages to improve SEO performance. This change prioritizes user-generated content in the HTML structure, making it more accessible to search engine crawlers.

## What Changed

### Before:
```html
<div class="business-container">
    <div id="rating-summary" class="rating-summary-container">
        <!-- Rating stars and summary -->
    </div>
    
    <!-- Other content -->
    
    <div class="reviews-section">
        <h2>Recenze</h2>
        <div id="reviews-list">

        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

### After:

        <!-- Rating stars and summary -->
    </div>
    
    <!-- Reviews Section (Moved for better SEO) -->
    <div class="reviews-section">
        <h2>Recenze</h2>
        <div id="reviews-list">
            <!-- User reviews -->
        </div>
    </div>
