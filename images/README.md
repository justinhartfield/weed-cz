## Adding Business Photos

To add photos for a business:

1. Create a folder named after the business slug: `businesses/business-name/`
2. Add photos with descriptive names: `exterior.jpg`, `interior.jpg`, `products.jpg`, etc.
3. Recommended image sizes:
   - Thumbnail: 400x300px
   - Gallery: 800x600px
   - Hero: 1200x800px

## Image Optimization

Before adding images:
- Compress images to reduce file size
- Use WebP format when possible
- Add descriptive alt text in the HTML

## Placeholder Images

The placeholder images are used when a business doesn't have custom photos yet.
These can be replaced with actual business photos over time.
